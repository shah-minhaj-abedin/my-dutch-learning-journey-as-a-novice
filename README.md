# my-dutch-learning-journey-as-a-novice
I have started learning Dutch language, I have some basics learned through Duolingo. I started this repository to keep track my learning and share it.

I started learning Dutch in 2 july, 2021. It started with Duolingo. It's pretty popular app for learning basics of language. Now in mid August I have started reading Dutch newsapapers. I don't know many words, but I have decided to continue. Because I believe if we don't jump into anything. Nothing is going to happen. I have started to read and write a blog here in Github in English. 
But I have plans to use the dutch <b>words</b> (woorden- this is the dutch for word, pretty similar!).  I have learned and will **learn new word** (nieuw woord leren) and dutch sentence structure in the process. I hope if I can continue this for months or years

In dutch Newspaper is called 'Krant', I have selected 'De Telegraaf'. Interesting enough to say, dutch language have two definite article, one of them is 'De', which is similar to 'The' in English. And 'Telegraaf' simply denotes to 'Telegraph' in English. I wonder so many **newspapers** (Krant) arund **the world** (De wereld) uses the **name**(naam) telegraph. May be it was one of the fastest **communication device** (communicatie apparaat) in **previous** (vorig) centuries. And the **name** (naam) telegraph is **well** (goed) established in our brain. So people can connect with the <b> name </b> (naam) also.

I have also a backgorund knowledge in German, this helped to much in learning Dutch. Many of the things are common between german and dutch. Such as in german 'I' is 'Ich', so in german the sentence **'I am a man'** should look like **'Ich bin ein mann'**, in dutch it looks like **'Ik ben een man'**.
Another similarity is in vocabulary, junge(dutch)-jongen(german)-boy(english), Vogel-Vogel-bird, Vrouw-Frau-Woman, Avond- Abend-Evening
I only started to learn, i think there will be many more in ahead. So practice from de krant.
One of the news in the sports section says, 'Paris Saint-Germain stelt debuut Lionel Messi nog even uit'

Few words from the headlines are very familiar, 'debuut' is one of them. The word 'Stelt' is to halt and 'nog even uit' means 'for a while'. I am basically using the google translate for the translation. So, the headline is Paris Saint-Germain halts the debut of Lionel Messi for a while. So we have to wait for the Messi show in Paris.
