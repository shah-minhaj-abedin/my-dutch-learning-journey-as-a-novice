# my-dutch-learning-journey-as-a-novice
I have started learning Dutch language, I have some basics learned through Duolingo. I started this repository to keep track my learning and share it.

I started learning Dutch in 2 july, 2021. It started with Duolingo. It's pretty popular app for learning basics of language. Now in mid August I have started reading Dutch newsapapers. I don't know many words, but I have decided to continue. Because I believe if we don't jump into anything. Nothing is going to happen. I have started to read and write a blog here in Github in English. 
But I have plans to use the dutch <b>words</b> (woorden- this is the dutch for word, pretty similar!).  I have learned and will **learn new word** (nieuw woord leren) and dutch sentence structure in the process. I hope if I can continue this for months or years

In dutch Newspaper is called 'Krant', I have selected 'De Telegraaf'. Interesting enough to say, dutch language have two definite article, one of them is 'De', which is similar to 'The' in English. And 'Telegraaf' simply denotes to 'Telegraph' in English. I wonder so many **newspapers** (Krant) arund **the world** (De wereld) uses the **name**(naam) telegraph. May be it was one of the fastest **communication device** (communicatie apparaat) in **previous** (vorig) centuries. And the **name** (naam) telegraph is **well** (goed) established in our brain. So people can connect with the <b> name </b> (naam) also.


As you can see there are similarities between the vocabularies of English and Dutch.
